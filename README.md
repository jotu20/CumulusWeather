# About this project
This app was the first large and most complex app I had ever built. It was coded and designed firsthand by me with little knowledge of either industry to learn the ins and outs of development with Xcode and design with the Sketch app. I wanted to work on something that made me think outside of my comfort zone and work with API's which I had never done before. I wanted to learn by doing, so I jumped in and learned many things along the way. Although it embarrasses me to see mistakes I made in my early years as an iOS Developer, it is a great representation of how much my knowledge and skillsets have grown over the years. 

This app was originally released in November 2018 with version 1.0. I sunset the app after version 2.2.29 in August 2021. Over the years, I have occasionally made the app visible in the App Store strictly to showcase my work.
